# FunkyRDR
In order to build, you'll need the pdcurses precompiled binaries. Extract [these files/folders](http://www.jeffpizano.com/funkyrdr/FunkyRDR-pdcurses-bin.zip) into the root directory of this repository and it should compile.

Here's a link to the binary for the lazy. [Download](http://www.jeffpizano.com/funkyrdr/funk.zip)
